"MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ is a scalable, high-performance, schemafree and "production ready":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Production+Deployments NoSQL database. This plugin implements the GORM functionality for MongoDB. Under the hood it uses "Morphia":http://code.google.com/p/morphia/ as a lightweight type-safe library for mapping domain classes to/from MongoDB.

h3. Features

See the "quickstart":2.%20Quickstart.html page for a usage example. You can also download a "petclinic sample application port":http://github.com/downloads/jkuehn/gorm-mongodb/petclinic-mongodb.zip which uses gorm-mongodb to see the use of embedded and referenced domain classes.
