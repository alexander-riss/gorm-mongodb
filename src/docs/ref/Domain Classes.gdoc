h1. Domain Class Usage

MongoDB domain classes are mapped using the "Morphia":http://code.google.com/p/morphia/ mapping library. For the plugin to recognize the domain classes it should map, the classes need to be annotated with the @import com.google.code.morphia.annotations.Entity@ annotation. Usually the classes are put in grails-app/mongo directory.
