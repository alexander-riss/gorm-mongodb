h1. TODOs / ideas for next releases

* implement getAll http://grails.org/doc/1.3.x/ref/Domain%20Classes/getAll.html
* update method: handle references to instances properly
* add support for addTo* methods from GORM
* implement equals method for mongo domains which compares the ids
>   def boolean equals(Object obj) {
>    if (obj instanceof MongoDomain) return obj.id == id
>    return super.equals(obj);
>  }
* contains and remove does not work on referenced collections -> because collections that use hashCode for comparison compare hashcodes and are not using equals
