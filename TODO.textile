h1. TODOs / ideas for next releases

* Add test for index definition syntax
* document new index definition syntax
* document new update method UpdateOperation http://code.google.com/p/morphia/wiki/Updating - Create an UpdateOperation and introduce a dsl which calls methods of updateoperation - breaking change
* check out "GORM Redis":http://grails.org/plugin/redis plugin and the "inconsequential":http://github.com/grails/inconsequential implementation and derive some best practices
* add option to drop database on startup (dbCreate = "create-drop" // one of 'create', 'create-drop','update' see http://grails.org/doc/1.3.x/guide/3.%20Configuration.html#3.3%20The%20DataSource)
* map Datastore methods onto Domain classes (as static and instance methods) - updateFirst, findAndUpdate
* update method: handle references to instances properly
* save method: add support for failOnError:true in grails 1.2 (GRAILS-4343)
* no ast transformation for abstract classes. find a way to mark classes that should not be transformed
* implement _unique_ index definition
* move config to dataSources, throw exception that tells to move config for upgraders. Create "Configuration" documentation
* implement GridFS access
* implement getAll http://grails.org/doc/1.3.x/ref/Domain%20Classes/getAll.html
* add support for addTo* methods from GORM
* contains and remove does not work on referenced collections -> because collections that use hashCode for comparison compare hashcodes and are not using equals
