h1. TODOs / ideas for next releases

* update method: handle references to instances properly
* implement unique index definition
* move config to dataSources, throw exception that tells to move config for upgraders
* implement GridFS access
* implement getAll http://grails.org/doc/1.3.x/ref/Domain%20Classes/getAll.html
* add support for addTo* methods from GORM
* contains and remove does not work on referenced collections -> because collections that use hashCode for comparison compare hashcodes and are not using equals

h1. NOTES

h2. Classes in grails-app/domain directory
