h1. TODOs / ideas for next releases

* add support for $addToSet http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Updating#Updating-%24addToSet or better: for easy command execution on Mongo Domains (add update method on instance)
* add support for addTo* methods from GORM
* implement equals method for mongo domains which compares the ids
>   def boolean equals(Object obj) {
>    if (obj instanceof MongoDomain) return obj.id == id
>    return super.equals(obj);
>  }
* contains and remove does not work on referenced collections -> because collections that use hashCode for comparison compare hashcodes and are not using equals
