Implement countAll

class BootStrap {

    def mongo

    def init = { servletContext ->
        def final metaClass = Wish.metaClass

        metaClass.static.countAll = { Map filter = [:], Map queryParams = [:] ->
            Query query = mongo.datastore.find(Wish)
            filter.each { k, v ->
              query.filter(k.toString(), v)
            }
            return query.countAll()
         }
    }

    def destroy = {
    }
}



* Make conversions between List and MorphiaIterator more convenient
* add a refresh method to instances, to pull current data from db again
* use "GMongo":http://blog.paulopoiati.com/2010/06/20/gmongo-0-5-released/ as driver wrapper
* check out "GORM Redis":http://grails.org/plugin/redis plugin and the "inconsequential":http://github.com/grails/inconsequential implementation and derive some best practices
* add WriteConcern to methods, where applicable
* move config to dataSources, throw exception that tells to move config for upgraders. Create "Configuration" documentation
* add option to drop database on startup (dbCreate = "create-drop" // one of 'create', 'create-drop','update' see http://grails.org/doc/1.3.x/guide/3.%20Configuration.html#3.3%20The%20DataSource)
* map Datastore methods onto Domain classes (as static and instance methods) - updateFirst, findAndUpdate
* Add test for index definition syntax
* document converter abilities
* save method: add support for failOnError:true in grails 1.2 (GRAILS-4343)
* no ast transformation for abstract classes. find a way to mark classes that should not be transformed
* implement GridFS access
* implement getAll http://grails.org/doc/1.3.x/ref/Domain%20Classes/getAll.html
* add support for addTo* methods from GORM
* contains and remove does not work on referenced collections -> because collections that use hashCode for comparison compare hashcodes and are not using equals

h2. Classes in grails-app/domain directory

* Validation methods are injected by Grails
