h1. TODOs / ideas for next releases

* document index mapping
* implement unique index definition
* implement getAll http://grails.org/doc/1.3.x/ref/Domain%20Classes/getAll.html
* update method: handle references to instances properly
* contains and remove does not work on referenced collections -> because collections that use hashCode for comparison compare hashcodes and are not using equals

* add support for addTo* methods from GORM
* upgrade to grails 1.3.4


h1. NOTES
